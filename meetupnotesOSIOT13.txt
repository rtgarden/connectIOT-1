Come and participate in the Open Source Internet of Things!
The internet of things is rapidly developing into a new set of tools.
Collaboration and tool development are our focus this year as we begin our meeting series again.
After our first hour of sharing concepts and ideas we will introducw our new buildout series.
The buildouts focus on hands on creation of working internet of things prototypes and
potential services which are both open source and proprietary in nature.

Our overall view is that in order for the internet of things to build out it needs 
to be based on a set of Open Source Tools, the development of which is now well underway.
Our hour of discussion will be a community oriented set of talks which will
survey the emerging landscape.


1 hour of discussion
2 hours of buildout

Lots of new boards and sensors are out there, several methods of deployment are available,
we would like to gather with the #OSIOT community and facilitate the development of new projects.
