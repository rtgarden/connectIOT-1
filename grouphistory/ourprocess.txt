Creating a record of the story of our connectIOT studio process


RHV begins 10-2011
weather station and remote 
system monitoring for Michaels ranch 
house in the hills. While he was staying at 
my cabin we were trying to avoid rough weather.
many good parameters revealed themselves quickly:
satelite is not robust enough.
automatic chicken doors need a lot of infrastructure
snow collects on the solar panels, as well as the satellite and the
weather monitor.


abracadabra 5-2012 studio in Eureka established with the intention of building out some ideas
for the internet of things. We constructed the first Peggy and peggy2 and very quickly discovered
that there was no real way to run them from the reaspberry pi
or arduino sets that we had.
smart object api
realized we needed to relocate to silicon valley.

OSIOT 10-2012 started the community meetup with the intention of encouraging
open source as an appropriate strategy for interoperability.
