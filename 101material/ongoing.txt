Starting to collect the material for IOT101:

initial project 1A:
do you have a github?
if no then follow process to get a github account.
also a user acct on the connectIOT forum.

This is the base for interactng with the teachers and the class.
The 101 repository will have all of the class material on github
and so your 1B assignment is to fork the repository and then clone it in your local desktop. 


Usually its a good practice to fork your own copy and clone that.
Basically using the distributed ability of github
everyone in the class has a st of instructional materials, and they re able to contribute
to the matrials and see each others contributions.
the whole system is also able to be monitored by the people in charge
of the project which in this case is instruction.

So basically the teachers can easily overview any additions that are made to the material
to be sure a high standard is being met.
This is all done with pull requests.

2A assignment should be the octocat/spoon-knife github fork a repo exercise:
https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo

pay special attention to how to create an upstream
from a master so that you can pull requests from the project:

git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master

altogether:
cd Spoon-Knife
# Changes the active directory in the prompt to the newly cloned "Spoon-Knife" directory
git remote add upstream https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife.git
# Assigns the original repository to a remote called "upstream"
git fetch upstream
# Pulls in changes not present in your local repository, without modifying your files

https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife



Node Red setup is probably next or in the sequence.
