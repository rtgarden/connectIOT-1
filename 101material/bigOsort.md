Big O reference notes
---------------------
methods of approaching scalability



focus on sorting methods:
balance of time, space annd energy.

parallel sorting sorts blocks seperately and combines the results.
saves time by breaking the results into components which
can be solved concurrently.

Basic Methods:

Bubble Sort-size of list multiplied by the number of passes.
This is basically n times n which means n becomes exponential and scaling fails.

*Quick Sort-
*Merge Sort-

selection sort-
insertion sort-




look at:
generator function-
looks at all the elements
similar to map reduce
